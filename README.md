# Boston_House_Prediction

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in Boston using various features such as crime rate, average number of rooms, and proximity to the Charles River.

## Dataset

The project uses the Boston Housing dataset, a widely used dataset in machine learning. It contains information about housing prices and various features for different neighborhoods in Boston.
