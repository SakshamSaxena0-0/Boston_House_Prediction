# Boston_House_Prediction

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in Boston using various features such as crime rate, average number of rooms, and proximity to the Charles River.

## Dataset

The project uses the Boston Housing dataset, a widely used dataset in machine learning. It contains information about housing prices and various features for different neighborhoods in Boston.

**Features:**

<ul dir="auto">
● CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town
● ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
● INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
● CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
● NOX: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
● RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling
● AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
● DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
● RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways
● TAX: Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
● PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
● B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of Black people by town
● LSTAT: % lower status of the population
</ul>

**Target Variable:**

<ul dir="auto">
● MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's
</ul>
